# Homomorphism Indistinguishability Zoo

This is the repository for the [Homomorphism Indistinguishability Zoo](https://tseppelt.github.io/homind-database), which summarises known facts about homomorphism indistinguishability relations.
Feel free to open an issue or contribute via pull requests. Any input or feedback is very welcome.

I apologise for the poor documentation of the technical backbone of the zoo. I'll try to improve this in the future.
